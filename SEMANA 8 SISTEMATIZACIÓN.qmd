## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
data<- read_csv("C:/Users/xioma/Downloads/cirrosis.csv")
View(cirrosis) 
```

```{r}
hist(data$Edad)
```
